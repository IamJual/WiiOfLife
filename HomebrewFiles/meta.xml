	<long_description>
	Game of Life is a cellular automaton 0-player game made by Jhon Horton Conway in 1970. In the "simulation" are just 4 rules that apply to each cell.

	1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
	2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
	3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
	4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

	In the game you can place any cell configuration on an almost infinite grid and watch how magicly the simulation runs.
